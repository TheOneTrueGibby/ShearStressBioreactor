# Value Proposition
Tendon-related injuries impact millions of people and collectively cost millions of dollars in medical expenses every year. Patients are left permanently debilitated in many cases, due to the poor natural healing capacity of tendon tissue. More research into cell mechanobiology is needed to both better understand the causes of such injuries and devise better means of treatment, and experimentation is best performed in an in vitro environment that can be carefully controlled, such as in a bioreactor. Unfortunately, existing bioreactor systems cost tens of thousands of dollars per unit, making them inaccessible to many researchers. Our goal is to design and build an easy-to-use and low-cost shear stress bioreactor that can deliver fluid shear stress to cells in culture without the need for overly expensive equipment. We will produce a fully operable prototype and instructions to replicate it, so it can be created for use by other labs. 

# Repository Overview
The software for the project is developed for the ESP 32 microcontroller with [PlatformIO.](https://platformio.org/) 
Forked off last years team project and used some of their previous code for project basis, located at https://github.com/CJ5518/ShearStressBioreactor
